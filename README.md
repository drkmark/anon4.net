# anon4.net
so far knowledge base of public dnssec capable non-blocking non-logging and non-filtered anonymized DNScrypt servers and relays provided by anon4.net, more about project at tmp site https://dnscrypt.one.

**!!! BEWARE !!!**

I've changed name of the project to **anon4.net**!


obviously, with this significant change server/relays hostnames have been changed as well. don't ask me why, because it's like that and it's final now. the webpage will be also redirected to the new one, better, more sexy and juicy for sure. just after I'll finish it...

**!!! BEWARE !!!**
